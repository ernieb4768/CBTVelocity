	<string name="body1">Velocity is our high school ministry here at the Canton Baptist Temple. We include all students in high school grades 9 through 12.</string>
	<string name="body2">At Velocity, we exist for the purpose of reaching and impacting the lives of students through pursuing a relationship with Jesus Christ. This ministry recognizes that all students are searching for something to fill the emptiness they experience and we are positive that these feelings of \“emptiness\” can only be satisfied when faith in Jesus Christ is experienced.</string>
